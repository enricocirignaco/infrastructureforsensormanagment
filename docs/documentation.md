# Methods
This chapter describes the methods used to organize and execute the project, including the project methodology, team structure, and chosen technologies. Since the project was carried out in a team of two, a structured approach was essential to avoid blocking progress due to interdependencies. Given the broad scope and limited timeframe, the project followed an iterative, practice-oriented methodology to maximize productivity. This approach allowed for continuous refinements based on supervisor feedback and evolving technical insights.
## Team Organisation
The project was carried out by a two-person team, which required proactive planning and a clear division of tasks to avoid mutual blocking. The nature of the project allowed for largely independent work streams, which were divided into two main domains: (1) data acquisition and management, and (2) device provisioning, flashing, and monitoring. Additionally, the development of the web application was split between frontend and backend responsibilities, with each team member focusing on one of the two.

After a joint planning and conceptualization phase—where the system architecture and project requirements were defined—the team members assumed roles aligned with their strengths and interests. Tasks were managed using Git branches, with each feature developed independently and later merged into the main branch upon completion. This workflow enabled parallel progress without friction.

To maintain alignment, the team held regular internal meetings to discuss progress and synchronize development. A recurring practice called the “marriage” ensured that frontend and backend components were periodically integrated and tested together. Every two weeks, the team also met with the project supervisor and stakeholder to demonstrate the current state of the system and gather feedback. Before these sessions, the latest features were merged, tested, and deployed to the server to provide a working prototype for review. This iterative process supported rapid, incremental improvements.
