This chapter describes the methods used to organize and execute the project, including the project methodology, team structure, and chosen technologies. Since the project was carried out in a team of two, a structured approach was essential to avoid blocking progress due to interdependencies. Given the broad scope and limited timeframe, the project followed an iterative, practice-oriented methodology to maximize productivity. This approach allowed for continuous refinements based on supervisor feedback and evolving technical insights.
